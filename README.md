📊 Loan Data Analysis Using NumPy

This project demonstrates how to perform structured data analysis using NumPy—focusing on memory efficiency, logical indexing, and vectorized operations—without relying on high-level libraries like pandas.

🔍 Project Objective
To analyze a real-world loan dataset and extract meaningful insights by:

Cleaning and transforming raw data using NumPy.

Handling missing values and mixed data types.

Applying boolean masking for conditional filtering.

Calculating statistical summaries across loan attributes.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python 3

NumPy

CSV file parsing using np.genfromtxt

📁 Dataset
The dataset loan-data.csv includes fields such as:

Loan Status

Term

Loan Amount

Interest Rate

Annual Income

Home Ownership

And more

📈 Key Operations
Detection and handling of missing values

Separation of numeric and categorical data

Conditional filtering (e.g., high-interest or long-term loans)

Descriptive statistics (mean, median, percentiles)

Segmented analysis (e.g., by loan approval status or income bracket)

🧠 Key Learnings
Manual data wrangling using low-level NumPy operations

Effective use of boolean indexing and logical operators

Understanding NumPy’s advantages in performance-critical applications
